# Introduction

Thanks for using Easy InSAR, a free and easy to use platform for DInSAR processing.

# What is InSAR?

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar, abbreviated InSAR (or deprecated IfSAR), is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. This geodetic method uses two or more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to generate maps of surface deformation or digital elevation, using differences in the phase of the waves returning to the satellite or aircraft. The technique can potentially measure millimetre-scale changes in deformation over spans of days to years. It has applications for geophysical monitoring of natural hazards, for example earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and in structural engineering, in particular monitoring of subsidence and structural stability.

# What is DInSAR?

The D in DInSAR stands for “Differential”, that means it is used to observe phase changes between two images in a given time. So, it is a series of technique that can help monitor time series of changes in the surface, especially the land deformation info. Currently, there are many DInSAR techniques available, among which the most advanced is PSInSAR(Persistent Scatterer InSAR) and SBAS(Small BAseline Subset), but the conventional double-paired interferogram is still used.

# What can this application do?

Firstly, downloading InSAR data, which is the first step to do if you want to produce any InSAR product. Don't worry, this application will do the downloading job for you, what you need to do is just input some parameters and wait for the application to finish fetching remote resources.

Despite of downloading data, this application can also help you to simply walk through the process of InSAR processing. You can choose the InSAR product you want to process, and the application will automatically generate the necessary files for you. Currently this application can serve you to process basic interferogram and do PSInSAR job(MATLAB license is required for the server-side to process PSInSAR data).

# So, how to use this application?

First, be sure to look at “Principles of InSAR” on the sidebar. It contains a lot information about what InSAR is. Not knowing the basic knowledge is harmful to your research. Then, please read the “Guidance of Easy InSAR Application”, which contains an real-world example, covering all the processes included in this app.
